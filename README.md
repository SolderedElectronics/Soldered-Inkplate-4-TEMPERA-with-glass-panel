Inkplate 4 TEMPERA is an easy-to-use, all-in-one device that puts the power of e-paper technology in the palm of your hand. Behind its 3.8-inch, 600Ã—600-pixel e-paper touchscreen, it packs the following features into one compact, elegant package: frontlighting, an abundance of sensors, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, a built-in battery, and a low-power operating mode.
